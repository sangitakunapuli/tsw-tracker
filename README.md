# TSW Tracker

One of the most frustrating conditions I have experienced thus far in my life has been TSW (Topical Steriod Withdrawal). You can read more about the condition here: https://www.itsan.org/us/what-is-tsw-syndrome/

Since this condition is caused by prolonged usage of steriod creams, the skin barrier becomes compromised and extremely sensitive - reacting to many external factors that were previously fine. This condition takes months to years to finally improve, with possibility of relapse.

This simple application aims to provide a calendar that serves as a daily log of symptoms and exposures. Hopefully this will serve as a starting point to establish a routine and identify triggers over time.
